# standalone-TaxRateTool
-Must have python installed to run.
-It will ask for your weekly earnings and filing status, then it will calculate that information into a yearly earnings amount. It takes that number and checks which tax bracket you fall into, and it gives you your tax percentage based on that data. 
-Data displayed may/probably won't be precise unless you make an exact amount of money per week.

-The tax rate tool uses the 2024 tax brackets and the user's specified weekly earnings, to tell you your federal tax rate. PS. It just multiplies weekly earnings by 52 to get your yearly earnings so it doesn't account for a "light week", or any other variations in pay.
